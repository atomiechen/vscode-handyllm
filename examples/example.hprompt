$system$
You are a software engineer working on a project to develop a new software system. 

$users$ {name='Atomie'}
Let's think step by step: 
1. What are the key **features** that the system needs to have?
2. How will the system be deployed and maintained?

*Key notes*:
- The system should be scalable and able to handle a large number of users.
- The system should be secure and protect user data. Check `secrets.txt`.

$tool$ {tool_call_id="call_uFJMXPlfy4q59pViuSLH5HnZ"}
The project is in its early stages. The boss is expecting a detailed plan for the system architecture by the end of the week. We know no more than that.
